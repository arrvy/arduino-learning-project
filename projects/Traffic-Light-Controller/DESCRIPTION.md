# Traffic Light Controller Using Arduino

The Arduino is the most popular open-source microcontroller board used for many electronics and DIY projects. Traffic light controller by using Arduino is a simple electronic project. Nowadays, everyone prefers a personal vehicle. Hence, the number of vehicles on the road is increasing continuously, which results in traffic jams.

Traffic light controller helps to manage the traffic and to maintain proper traffic management. These systems are placed at the intersections of the road or at the crossings to avoid congestions and accidents. The systems indicate to the driver by using different colours of light. Therefore it is simple to avoid congestion at the intersections.

This project is the traffic light controller by using Arduino. It is an electronic project by which we will get knowledge about traffic lights and how they work. This project is the simple version of a traffic light system where we have demonstrated it for three sides or ways.
